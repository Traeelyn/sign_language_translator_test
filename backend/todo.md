What i want to do

- Create a platform that allows deaf people and non-deaf people to communicate

Problem

- Alot of normal people find it hard to communicate with deaf people because most normal people dont know sign language

Goal

- Reduce communication barriers for deaf people & allow them to integrate better in the real world

To do

- Train model
- Get different sign language letters and meanings and feed it to the ai model
- Allow to access webcam so users can sign
- The signed language will be automatically trandslated to text

Some ideas

- Use the already given alphabet hand images
- Maybe can go through the internet to find videos of certain sign langugae impressions...ex clapping

for now just focus on asl

- TRAIN MODEL TO RECOGNISE ONLY A AND J FOR NOW
